            <h3>BROWN BEAR</h3>
            <p>
              I always wanted to fold a bear in origami, but by 2024 (the year
              when I was looking for bear models) I found very few designs with
              diagrams that I truly liked. Perhaps the best ones I found were
              the bears by Quentin Trollip; however, I also wanted to achieve
              something in the style of Nicolás Gajardo and Shuki Kato. At the
              beginning of 2025, I set out to design my own brown bear, using
              some of Kamiya's proportions as a guide, especially those he used
              in his cattle model. I conceived the entire design while traveling
              in Medellín around mid-April. This is the second version of the
              design, updated in December 2025. I could retire from the world of
              origami and feel completely satisfied having my own origami bear.
